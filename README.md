## üìã Overview

**VitalEyes** is a full-stack web application designed for real-time health monitoring. It features a responsive and dynamic frontend dashboard that displays live sensor data, including heart rate, SpO2, body temperature, and more. The application also includes an AI-powered chat assistant, powered by the Gemini API, which can interpret health data and answer user questions.
